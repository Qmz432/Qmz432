### Hi there 👋
- 😊I'm Qmz432 and of course it's not my true name but I'm willing to share some of my ideas and works here.
- 🔭I'm currently working on two main projects below:
   - ⭐[Ultrasound-image](https://github.com/Qmz432/Ultrasound-imaging-device), this project aims at designing an easy self-made ultrasound imaging device. It mainly consists of "Phased-array transducer", "Pulse-control board", "Related algorism". And I will update my latest work every Sunday.
   - ⭐[Lazy-laying](https://github.com/Qmz432/Lazy-laying), is a project to explore how to auto place the components in PCB according to their properties. And I will update this project every Sunday. It will be mainly about the project's ideas and how to realize the function.
- 📧I’m working alone on these projects, so if you wanna to participate in, I'm happy to work with you. And you could contact me at qmzs12345@gmail.com.
